<h2>Oliver Twist Act 1 Scene 1</h2>
<p><span data-actor="Child">CHILD: Hey, Oliver! Where are you going?</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: I'm so hungry.</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Child">CHILD: Me too, but this soup is disgusting! I feel like throwing it up.</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: Me too, but I'm still too hungry… My stomach won't stop making noises, I need to eat more!</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Child">CHILD: Don't go, Oliver. You'll make it worse.</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: I don't care! My stomach aches… </span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Child">CHILD: Don't you remember what happened to Sami? They locked him in the attic for three days!</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: (scared) In the dark…</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Child">CHILD: And without food!</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: (stubborn and brave). I don't care! I want more food!</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: Sir…Please Sir…. can I have some more? (hands him his bowl).</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Cook">COOK: Silly boy! Who are you!?</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: My name is Oliver, Sir. Oliver Twist.</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Cook">COOK: And what do you want, huh?</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: I'm starving to death…I just wanted to know if I could have some more…</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Cook">COOK: Don't you know that it's forbidden to get up from the table during dinner?</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: Yes Sir, I know that but, you see, I just…</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Cook">COOK: You just what? (threatening him)</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: I…I…</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Cook">COOK: What boy, what? Don't be scared! You what? </span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: I know that we can't get up from the table, but we are starving! One ladle of soup isn't enough for us!</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Cook">COOK: That's it!!! Enough!!! Now, shut up!</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: I'm sorry, Sir</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Cook">COOK: Shut up! If you don't like what we give you, then get your things and leave!</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: I'm sorry… I don't have anywhere to go Sir. </span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Cook">COOK: Really?! You rude and ungrateful little boy! You don't have anywhere to go and you complain about the people who give you a bed to sleep in, food and a table to eat it on?</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: I said that I'm sorry…I didn't mean to be rude, I only wanted…</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Cook">COOK: Ha, Ha, ha… I know what devils like you need, come with me boy! We are going!</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Oliver">OLIVER: No, Sir, please, don't lock me in the attic!!!</span></p>
<p><span data-actor="Cook">COOK: No, not in the attic… I'm taking you somewhere you'll have to work
  hard! Then you will learn to value your food! (villainous laughter). </span></p>
